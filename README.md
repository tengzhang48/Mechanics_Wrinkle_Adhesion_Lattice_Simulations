# Mechanics_Wrinkle_Adhesion_Lattice_Simulations
This shares the simulation files for the paper "Mechanics of tunable adhesion with surface wrinkles". It includes the following files:
1. Lammps scripts to simulate surface wrinkle formation and evolution, 2D adhesion, Wrinkled adhesion
2. Lammps source files for implmenting the continuum energy associated area change in the neo-Hookean solids
3. Matlab code to generate the data files for Lammps simulations
