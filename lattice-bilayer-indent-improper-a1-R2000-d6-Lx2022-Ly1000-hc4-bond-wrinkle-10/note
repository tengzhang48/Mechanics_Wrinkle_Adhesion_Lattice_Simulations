This folder contains the Lammps script for simulating the wrinkled adhesion, with film thickness as 4.
Compressive strain as 0.1, and the depth of the energy well of the L-J potential is 1. 
Parameters can be modifiedFor for other simulation cases.
Please create two folders "fxyz" and  "txt" to store the simulation outputs
